# Sprint 7 project
# DeAndre's Sprint 7 Project

## Description
This project consists of writing tests for various HTTP requests made to endpoints of the Urban Grocers API. The tests ensure that the API endpoints return the expected responses and data. The tests are categorized based on the type of HTTP request being made: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **JavaScript:** The tests are written in JavaScript using the Jest testing framework.
- **Node.js:** The tests run in a Node.js environment.
- **Command Prompt:** Command Prompt was used for running commands and managing the project.
- **Visual Studio:** Visual Studio was used as the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and editing code.

## Instructions to Run Tests
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in Command Prompt.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the command: npm install

Task 1: Tests for GET Requests
4. Select Endpoint: Choose an endpoint from the Urban Grocers documentation that you want to test.
5. Write Tests:
   - Write a test to send a GET request to the chosen endpoint.
   - Check the response status code to ensure it's correct.
   - Parse the response body and verify that it contains the expected data.

Task 2: Tests for POST Requests
6. Choose Endpoint: Select a POST endpoint from the Urban Grocers documentation.
7. Write Tests:
   - Write a test to send a POST request to the chosen endpoint.
   - Check the response status code to ensure it's correct.
   - Parse the response body and verify that it contains the expected data.

Task 3: Tests for PUT Requests
8. Pick Endpoint: Choose a PUT endpoint from the Urban Grocers documentation.
9. Write Tests:
   - Write a test to send a PUT request to the chosen endpoint.
   - Check the response status code to ensure it's correct.
   - Parse the response body and verify that it contains the expected data.

Task 4: Tests for DELETE Requests
10. Select Handler: Choose a DELETE handler from the Urban Grocers documentation.
11. Write Tests:
   - Write a test to send a DELETE request to the chosen handler.
   - Check the response status code to ensure it's correct.
   - Parse the response body and verify that it contains the expected data.


12. Run the tests by executing the command: npx jest tests/
